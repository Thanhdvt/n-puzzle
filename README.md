# N-Puzzle Solver Game

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for an N-Puzzle Solver game developed in C#. The N-Puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle game where players must rearrange the numbered tiles in a grid to solve the puzzle. This project also includes basic AI algorithms to solve the puzzle automatically.

## Features
* `N-Puzzle Game`: Play the N-Puzzle game interactively by sliding tiles to solve the puzzle manually.

* `AI Solvers`: Includes basic AI algorithms such as the A* search algorithm to solve the puzzle automatically.

* `Customizable`: Choose the size of the puzzle grid (e.g., 3x3, 4x4) and the algorithm for solving it.

* `Visual Representation`: The game provides a graphical representation of the puzzle and the solving process.

# Getting Started
To run the N-Puzzle Solver game, you need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-puzzle.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``` bash
cd n-puzzle
```

3. Build and run the application:

``` bash
dotnet run
``` 

4. The N-Puzzle Solver game should start, allowing you to play the game or choose an AI algorithm to solve it automatically.

## Usage

* `Playing the Game`: Use arrow keys or mouse clicks to slide tiles and solve the puzzle manually.

* `Using AI Solvers`: Choose an AI algorithm (e.g., A*) from the menu to solve the puzzle automatically. The application will visualize the solving process.

* `Customization`: Customize the puzzle size and solver algorithm using the options menu.

## Directory Structure

* `src`: Contains the C# source code files for the N-Puzzle Solver game.

* `images`: Stores images or assets used in the game.

## AI Algorithms
The project includes basic AI algorithms for solving the N-Puzzle:

* `BFS Search Algorithm`
* `DFS Search Algorithm`
* `A* Search Algorithm`
You can explore and extend these algorithms in the source code.
